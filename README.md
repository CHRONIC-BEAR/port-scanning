# port-scanning
these use the socket.socket() object to connect to a designated IP address at a designated port, returning statements that suggest the port is 
open, or closed.
# mpscan
this program makes use of the threading class in python, using multiple threads to scan ports making for a faster scanning speed for multiple port scanning
# pscan
this program will scan through a selected range of ports,marking them as closed or open, after each connection, it theoretically takes half a second or so to move on to the next port,
making for less than optimal scanning speeds (READ THE PROGRAM'S ENDING COMMENT)
# spscan
the single port scan will only scan 1 selected port, and output a statement stating whether it is open or closed
